# Hycs [![Rust](https://github.com/Veikkosuhonen/compiler/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Veikkosuhonen/compiler/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A simple C-like language I wrote in HY Compilers 2024. It compiles to x86_64 assembly and also has an interpreter.

I also made a [vscode plugin](https://github.com/Veikkosuhonen/hy-compilers-language-support) for it to add syntax highlighting 

## Current features

- All the basic C language feature such as...
- Variables, If, While, Functions
- Handwritten parser
- Interpreter
- Type checker
- Compile to x86_64 assembly
- Lots of unit- and E2E tests

## Todo

- Pointers
- Arrays
- Structs
- First-class functions
